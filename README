Huffman.c
Jared Peter-Contesse (jared.peter.contesse@gmail.com)

This is an example of an implementation of the huffman coding algorithm
to compress/decompress files. The algorithm finds the optimal binary
replacement of each charater in a file using a table of frequency counts
and huffman tree. This code sample can both encode and decode files.

usage: hencode [infile] [outfile]
	infile: The name of the file that will be compressed
	outfile: The name of the compressed file that will be created

usage: hdecode [infile] [outfile]
	infile: The name of the compressed huffman file
	outfile: The name of the decompressed file that will be created
